## Overview
In this project, we recreated a controlled visualization experiment inspired by Cleveland & McGill (1984) and later replications. Participants completed a sequence of randomized trials where two values in a chart were marked and they estimated **"what percent is the smaller of the larger?"**. We comparied the accuracy across three visualization conditions: Bar, Comparative Bar, and stacked Bar. Responses were graded by computeing the true percent against the reported percent for each trial using the Cleveland-McGill log-base-2 error metric.

## Experiment Screenshots (TBD)
- show UI screenshots of each page/stage of the experiment

## Conditions (Visualizations Tested)
**Overall Goal:** To test how visualization design affects ratio-judgement accuracy, with our overall hypothesis being that the closer the two marked values are (spatially), the easier it is to compare their lengths and estimate the ratio, leading to a lower log2error.

### 1. Bar Chart (TBD)
- **Hypothesis:**
- Include example screenshot

### 2. Comparative Bar Chart (TBD)
- **Hypothesis:**
- Include example screenshot

### 3. Stacked Bar Chart (TBD)
- **Hypothesis:**
- Include example screenshot

## Procedure
- 60 trials per participant (20 trials per condition)
- Randomized trial order to ensure conditions were shown randomly
- 10 total participants -> 200 trials per condition
- Participants would enter a whole percent from 0 to 100

## Data Generation
- Each trial is generated by:
-- randomly choosing 10 values from the range 0 to 100
-- choosing 2 random marked values by index
- There are 20 trials generated per condition and then the order is shuffled
- Each visualization is then generated based off the data for the trial

## Error Metrics
- **TruePercent** = round((smaller/larger) * 100)
- **ReportedPercent** = rounded whole % input
- **log2error** = log2(|ReportedPercent - TruePercent| + 1/8)
- **Special Error Case:** if ReportedPercent == TruePercent, set Error to **0** (instead of log2(1/8) = -3)

## Results (TBD)
- report the order in which the visualizations yielded the best results and report their log2 error
- 1. Best Condition: 
- 2. Second Best Condition: 
- 3. Third Best Condition:

## Figures (TBD)
- visualize results from data analysis
- 95% CI error bars
- explain all visualization results

## Data (TBD)
- explain data from results
- how we copied each participants' results and pasted them into master.csv for analysis
- what columns we output

## Technical Achievements
- Multi-screen experiemnt flow (Welcome -> Instrictions -> Trials -> Results)
- Randomized trial generation
- D3 rendering for three separate visualizations
- Keyboard submits, progess indicator, etc.
- Response validation, logging, and CSV output

## Design Achievements
- Clear markings with red color
- Consistent scale across conditions
