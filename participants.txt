If we're running 20 trials of each condition for each participant, we will 
need 10 participants to reach the 200 trials per condition requirement.

List people we can ask:

ParticipantID   Name
001             Lutz (did not understand what stacked bar was showing)
002             Marsh (bar distance didn't really affect him, focused on the numbers)
003             Pat (mostly size ratio, sometimes the math. If the bars were further, would rely on the math.)
004             Maher (didn't look at numbers, looked at proportions)
005             Adrian (done)
006             DeBrito (initially looked at height proportions but validated with numbers when in between ticks)
007             Morgan (would look at numbers and do a rough estimate on the math and confirmed with bars to make sure it made sense visually)
008             Butters
009             McVeigh
010             Bailey
